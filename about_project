The project, titled "Fire Monitoring by Vision and Smell," was an innovative endeavor aimed at improving early fire detection using advanced sensor technologies. 
Our team consisted of 4 people, including a team leader, analyst, programmer, simulation specialist. Our goal was to develop a system that could more effectively detect signs of fire by analyzing visual and olfactory data.

The path of our project is comprehensively documented on Google Drive, including the challenges we faced, the solutions we developed, and the entire development process. 
This documentation serves not only as a record of our project's life cycle, but also as a valuable resource for others working in the field of fire detection and security technology.
